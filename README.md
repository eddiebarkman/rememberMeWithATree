This was a web app I built to learn how to use PHP and connect it with a database.

The basic idea was to plant a digital tree in memory of someone. The name and age of the person were recorded in the database and could be recalled by going to their instance of the tree page. The tree itself was set on a timer, depending on how long ago the tree had been created, a different stage of growth image would be loaded.

It was a fun experiement to work on and get fully functioning at the time. Though it wont function anymore, this is the code I wrote for it.
